# Project Name

## Next.js Full Stack Project with MySQL, Sequelize, Axios, MUI, Bcrypt, Body-parser, Cors

### Overview

This project is a full-stack web application built using Next.js, MySQL, Sequelize, Axios, MUI (Material-UI), Bcrypt, Body-parser, and Cors. It serves as a foundation for creating robust and scalable web applications with a modern tech stack.

### Features

- **Next.js:** A React-based framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **MySQL:** A relational database management system used for storing and managing data.
- **Sequelize:** An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js, which simplifies database interactions and supports multiple database systems, including MySQL.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests, facilitating communication between the frontend and backend.
- **MUI (Material-UI):** A React UI framework that provides a set of customizable components following Google's Material Design principles.
- **Bcrypt:** A library for hashing passwords, enhancing security by protecting sensitive user data.
- **Body-parser:** Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a Node.js application.
- **Cors:** Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing controlled access to resources from different domains.
